A repo from command line directly to a GitHub repo!
===================================================

Be advised, the GitHub repo was manually created, just to have a url and somewhere to push to.

Right now, I'm following [this GitHub](1) tutorial.

[This one](2) from Atlassian is also good, altough it says something about SVN (what is that?).
